## Comments:
#### This application is a game written in VB.net that prompts each player for their name, and a port number to communicate through with a friend. Each player will also select an avatar. Within the game, the players use their mice to move their characters. The object of the game is to decrease the other playerâ€™s health by moving your character on top of theirs and right-clicking. While the characters are still alive, you can also type a message to the other players. Once a character dies, then they are removed from the game.
